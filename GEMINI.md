# Project Overview

This project is a personal portfolio website for Muhammad Abubakar, a software developer and geologist. The website showcases his projects, work experience, skills, and educational background. It is a static website built with HTML, CSS, and a small amount of JavaScript.

The website has a clean and modern design with a light and dark theme switcher. It is also responsive, adapting to different screen sizes for optimal viewing on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

# Building and Running

This is a static website, so there is no build process required. To run the website, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

# Development Conventions

The project follows a simple and straightforward structure.

*   **HTML:** The main content is in `index.html`.
*   **CSS:** All styles are in `assets/css/style.css`.
*   **JavaScript:** The `assets/js/app.js` file is currently empty. All JavaScript functionality is handled by inline scripts in `index.html`.
*   **Images:** All images are located in the `assets/img` directory.

The CSS is well-structured with a clear separation of concerns. It uses CSS variables for theming and a utility-class-based approach for layout and spacing.
